  The crisis of obesity appears more unstoppable than ever. obesity is soaring around the world, increasing more than tenfold
over the past four decades. Obesity is medically defined as having a body-mass index of more than 30. A recent report released by the 
World Health Organization shows that almost 40 percent of adults and nearly 20 percent of adolescents are obese. Overweight and obese 
children have a higher risk to stay obese and childhood obesity is linked to a higher chance of early death in adulthood.

  The reason why most people cannot lose weight is lack of time and guidance and inability to afford personal trainers and dieticians. 
The web application we are going to develop is a fitness app called My Fitness Buddy and will address the obesity problem. 
Since the web application will be hosted on a cloud platform and accessible via internet, the users can use the app from anywhere, 
anytime. This web application is particularly useful for people who have limited knowledge about fitness. My fitness buddy App will perform
various functions such as allowing users to set fitness goals, tracking caloric intake, gathering workout ideas, and sharing progress
